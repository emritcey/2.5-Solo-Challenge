<h3>HTML Comparison - 2.5 assignment</h3>
<p>I compared my website to Lonely Planet's Thailand page, which is linked in the footer below.  Their website is a lot more advanced than mine, with videos on the front page, rotating image banners, search bars, and much more content. It also has drop down lists, and is more aesthetically pleasing than my page, which is very bare bones and basic. 
<br /> Looking at the source code there is a lot of things that I do recognize, but in a lot more of an advanced form. There was a lot that I didn't recognize! One that popped out is the "symbol" tag. I am going to guess that this is used for buttons to navigate around the site. It is used a lot in thier code. </p>
